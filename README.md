### More License Details 

To clarify my intent with this license. Under CC-BY-NC-SA I can stipulate looser
restrictions, and do so.
*  You can freely modify all models/files provided you keep the same license, this is
Share Alike. You will have the same rights with your models/files as I do with my
models/files.
* You can resell parts you have purchased from V1 Engineering Inc, but not parts you’ve
printed yourself from my models. If you want to sell parts for a single machine you
privately printed with my models can do so freely in the forums. I would prefer all
non-licensed sales to happen here, the For Sale section. Selling in other places
muddies the boundaries for un-authorized sellers. If you are unclear please just email
me.
* You can use any of the machines commercially. You can use it in a video, at events, in
a business, including charging for it’s time or making products that you sell. You can
use it in a non-profit or commercial setting. You just can’t sell the parts made from my
models. You can’t sell something (electronics/hardware kits, assembly course,
training) and include my parts “for free”.

It really is that simple. **Anyone** that wants to **use** or **make** any of my machines, 
can....**for free**. I do everything I can to make these things easy to source and assemble globally,
and use as few unique tools as possible, you are also not locked into any sort of specific
hardware or firmware. If you did not want to buy anything from me, you should not
have to. I also provide a friendly and welcoming place to get help if needed, and clear
assembly instructions (if you find something is not clear you can even help out and
suggest a change).

The one stipulation I have is please, do not sell my designs or the parts that those
designs make. If you want to make your own please make it significantly difierent so the
new users would have no problem recognizing that it is not my part and use the same
license.
